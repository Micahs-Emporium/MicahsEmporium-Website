To kill and to feed.</em> <br>
Surrounded by cold and ridge filled terrain, the people of Tharr have adapted their hunting practices to no longer rely on chasing down pray. Neither do they attempt to set traps, hoping those will resist the harsh winter environment long enough to capture wildlife. <br>
They have adapted the shepherds leap used by their ancestors to heard livestock, into a hunting style designed to catch large prey in an energy conserving fashion. <br>
Before the hunting itself can take place, scouts will set out to find game trails which route beside cliffsides or other ledges, and confirming via signs like tracks that is still well used by large mammals. <br> <br></p><p>Once multiple of these routes have been discovered a hunter will pick one, based on a few factors: <br>
- Wind direction; A spot where the wind will not carry the scent of the hunter out over the trail, and alert the hunters prey of their location. <br>
- Weather forecast; A spot not compromised by the suspected upcoming weather. Like snow limiting vision or rain causing slippery rock sides. <br>
- Amount of hunters joining; being able to tag in and out with other hunters may make longer waits for larger game worth it. <br>
- Skill of the hunter; routes with easier or more frequent pray passing by may be better suited for a learning hunter. <br><br></p><p>When a route has been chose the hunter will set up their "shop". Depending on the route and expected wait time, the setup may range from their own clothes, tools and a rope for hauling to a tent, materials for a campfire, a sled for carrying successful kills and more. <br>
Once a shop has been established a hunter will set themselves up on a spot above a game trail, like into the crevice of a rocky ledge or on top of a cliffside. Often with little more than thick clothing, some rope and a long spear. <br>
They will remain deathly still until a mammal they consider of high enough worth crosses down beneath them. At which point they will drop themselves off the side of the cliff, aiming to impale the animal, using the long stick of the spear to slow down their descent and keep their balance in the process.<br>
The aim of this jump is a clean kill with the spear alone, in a spot where the weapon causes as little damage to the hide of the animal as possible. Though most hunters will still carry a knife on their person, in the case the initial leap was not enough to finish off an animal. <br>
Each hunter, as they gain more practice, will slowly develop their own preferences in hunting. Where one hunter may let many animals pass them by before they pounce the perfect one, another may go for all prey who pass, even bringing extra weaponry to claim more kills in one trip. &lt;br&lt;
Some hunters prioritize the size of the kill and may even go in pairs, aiming to jump a prey twice their size as a duo. Others may find more value in the hide of an animal and might make use of finer tipped spears as to not risk too much damage. <br> <br>
Regardless of the personal style of an individual, shepherd spear hunting overall is a skill defined by patience, decisiveness and consistency. One must foster a body capable of complete stillness as well as abrupt strong movement and a mind at peace with silence. </p></div>
