<p style="font-size:16px;"> <p style="line-height:22px;"><p><em>The Split Village</em> <br></p><p>A town crafted from the hands of nomads, settled around a fertile riverbed, taken up by the river itself for only a grand part of the year. Tharr is a settlement made up of roughly two dozen houses, a large townhouse called <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Shepherds%2520Well.html">The Shepherds Well</a> and an array of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Shrines%2520of%2520Tharr.html">shrines</a> made up of windchimes and wooden poles singing with the wind.
<br> <br></p><h3 class=""><strong>The birth of Tharr</strong></h3><p>When the settlers of Tharr came upon the land they would start calling home, it was nothing but a large forest clearing, cleaved in half by a strip of overgrown land. A strip they quickly found to be quite fertile. They had but managed half a harvest before the melting glacier ice higher up the mountains send down a raging river. An unexpected sight to wake up to. One that luckily harmed none of their own, but left the travelling party split in two. Lead by a desire to reunite, they decided to try and wait out the river. Hoping it was not a curse of the gods stowed upon them, but merely a natural phenomenon they had yet to understand.  <br>
In the 4 months that followed, the settlers had found the surrounding forest to be plentifull and strong, abundent with the voices of the wind sprits. </p><p>When their hopes were proven justified and the river dimmed down enough to allow crossing, the idea of home had burrowed its way into many of the nomads minds. Thus a settlement was started. </p><p>First settled simply on one side of the river, the people of Tharr set upon another season of tillage, this time keeping the oncoming flood of water in mind. They prioritised quick growing vegetables, large hauls and food meant for long storage. It was a far more succesfull harvest later that year, and no folk were seperated from the rest when the second thrashing river came around.  <br>
It was this year that the name Tharr came to the village, late one night by the fire, when the wind spirits blessed the first coming of water. The searing of the wind blending with the rush of water to speak forth the name that many generations following would learn as a word synonymous to home.</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>
