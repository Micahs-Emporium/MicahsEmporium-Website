A language the patient may learn.</em> <br>
The people of Tharr, like many people high up in the northern mountains, seek affirmation and guidence from spirits of old, residing in the winds of the world. They find their wisdom and speech in the rustling of leaves moved by the wind, the rushing of air up mountains and rockcliffs, the icy crackling of a breeze through powdery snow.</p><p>These spirits, found everywhere people go, are intertwinded into the daily life of this small village. There is always whistling or whispering to find your way to. </p><p>One, more intentional, way all in Tharr reach out to the wind spirits is through small shrines found all over the village. Each made up of two parts; firstly a wind chime hanging from local trees and made of small bits of wood and bone, secondly a spiral of hollowed out branches set in the ground beneath it. <br>
The wind chime consists of something those in Tharr call 'first pickings'. Whenever one goes out for lumber or firewood, the first branch to break off a tree or to be gathered off the forest floor is considered 'meant for the wind spirits'. When one has had a succesfull hunt, the first bone to come free from the animals carcass is considered the same. <br>
As the spirits stand more in tune with the nature that gifted them these items necessary for survival, they are granted these first pickings as an offering. These are burnt, buried, cast off cliffsides or sometimes added to these windchimes. The uniqueness of each piece brings a new note to the chimes repertoire, and with it grants each instrument its own personal tune .<br>
The hollowed out branches are a part of a festivity the village gathers together for, each time the central river runs dry. During it, all folks alive and well- or unwell have a branche measure to their height. These pieces of wood, once cut, are hollowed out and added to a persons own spiral shrine, adding to the tale of growth it shows throughout its many branches. This too, over time, creating a unique addition to a shrines melodies. <br>
The steady humming the wind spirits produce when passing over the spirals on the ground, combined with the eratic muciality of the windchimes makes for a musical conversation one cannot be art of anywhere else in nature. </p><p>Though this is the most usual way Tharr erects its shrines, it isnt the only one. <br>
Sometimes fisherman, out on a long trip, set up just the bottom half of these shrines with bundles of cut straw, cutting them each to the height of a new catch. These small spirals serving almost as a diary to their outing as much as they are a shrine to the spirits. The straw a whole new instrument to the orchestra of wind. <br>
Hunters, when out on long trips away from home, may attach swiftly made windchimes to bags of food tied high onto tree branches. With it they ask the spirits who may have come with them on their track to ward off any unwelcome visitors during the night. </p><p>It is through this practise that one and all sharing in it develop their own connection to, and language with, the local spirits. Recognizing notes, melodies or tunes as ones of comfort, personhood, warning, connection and more.</p></div>
