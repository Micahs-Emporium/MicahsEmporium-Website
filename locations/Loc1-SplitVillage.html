  <h2>The Split Village</h2>
  <p> A long fall and rush down from the Nich'kura mountains lies Tarr, a small mountain village split in two by a deep riverbed. <br>
One which lies dry for most of the year, and serves the town as a main road. For the brief few months where the melting glacier ice fills the river with rushing water, it splits the village in two. <br>
Thynemos and Arjal, the two ground folk who serve and lead the community, each take half of Tarr under their wing when the raging stream divides the village.
