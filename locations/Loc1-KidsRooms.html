  <h1>The Kids Bedrooms</h1>
  <p> it was a quick trial and fail to have Irith's three adopted kids share a bedroom. So, two nes walls and doors were quicky installed and each of them now enjoy their own private room. <br>
  Even though this did nothing to keep the three rascals out of each others hair, a private place is healthy for any humanoid, no?</p>
