  <h2>The Public Pantry</h2>
  <p> Cold weather, harsh season changes and the long hours that handwork may take has granted the village a united value; No material is wasted. <br>
  Where food items get kept in the taverns kitchen and the preserve wells, the non-preishables often get brought to the public pantry. A stoll on the left of the entry holds stacks of blankets with next to it a woven basket for items in need of mending. <br>
  The shelves that line the walls are covered with neatly folded piles of outgrown clothing and the buckets and chest at the back hold household items like pans, brooms and more. It is generaly agreed upon that the children only go in here withadult supervision, lest some items go missing or get lost.</p>
