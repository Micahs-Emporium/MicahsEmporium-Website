  <h2>The Master Bedroom</h2>
  <p> Even the owner of a dayround gathering place needs plenty of rest and privacy. <br>
The shell of this house was made far before Irith and Agaish moved in, however the interior is most their own. Agaish' Woodworking skills granted them a graceful, and most importantly  sturdy, bed. <br>
This along with matching sidetables, a chest for heavy personal items and some other bits and bobs for clothing, belongings and more. <br>
