  <h2>The Mountain Ridge of the Nomads</h2>
  <p>A wonderfull sight throughout this world sanning mountain ridge are the nomads crossing its many relentless peaks. <br>
  Dotted around, every few hundred miles, are their sacred waypoints; Small one-building settlements ran by the wisest of the elders. <br>
  These waypoints provide shelter for those unable to continue the nomadic lifestyle, due to illness, pregnancy or other, but they also play a huge roll in the resupplying of the passing caravans.</p>
