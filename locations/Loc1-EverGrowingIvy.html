  <h1>The Forest of Evergrowing Ivy</h1>
  <p> A type of ivy designed to rid a large piece of land of all things natural and bio. A seed of it can be planted in the center of the area needed to be cleared. It grows 3 feet a day in all possible directions and can penetrate into the ground easily to access roots, etc. <br>
It grows in steps. <br>
First using the power in the planted seed to grow to a square foot around itself. <br>
Afterwards it will latch onto any and all organisms/corpses/plants in its reach and starts feeding off of that. <br>
The originally planted seed remains the ivy's heart. <br>
All nutrients are transported to the center of the ivy and back out to the ends. Destroying the heart kills the ivy. Once the heart is killed the whole plant, regardless of its size, withers into a sort of dirt/dust. <br>
The seed can be planted straight into the soil or the feeding ground (I.e. bark of a tree. A corpse, etc.) <br>
It is often used to clear out grave sites or get rid of dangerous plants. The heart needs to be destroyed, otherwise it will lay dormant till the end of time until something new is fed to it, making it resume growth until the food runs out again. It does not differentiate between alive or dead, so a living soul wading through it to find the heart needs to be careful to not stay in one place so the plant can't get to them. 
If the heart of the plant is further away then the trip one person could manage without sleeping or otherwise settling for a while, it quickly becomes impossible to destroy it. <br>

<h2> The forbidden Forest <h2>
A location where just this has happened. A large Overgrowing Ivy was originally placed at a graveyard, where relentless undead rose up at a disturbing pace, in the hopes it would take care of it. Sadly the undead seemed to need no sleep and thus a lot survived and still roam around inside the Ivy. 
These treats in the way posed a dangerous threat for anyone entering the forest. Once the area became so large that one person couldnâ€™t possibly make the trip to the heart without collapsing from exhaustion the island was doomed. In the years following, the ivy engulfed all life upon it.  
Now only being held back by the rivers around it, the Iv lays dormant, but still alive. <br>
The waters serve it few living things that remain still for long enough to feed the ivy. Few, however, is not none. <br>
