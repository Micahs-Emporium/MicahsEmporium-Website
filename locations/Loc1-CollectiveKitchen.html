  <h2>The Collective Kitchen</h2>
  <p>The heart of a home is a kitchen, and this seems not only the case for this Tavern, but for the whole village. <br>
  All food in the village i hunted and grown by those who live in Tarr. Those who get in meats or produce put aside what they need for their own home first and next share it with those directly arounf them. <br> 
Whatever food doesnt get any immediate takers gets brought to the Shephards Well to be coocked and served by Irith, her partner and her 3 kids. There is no charge for eating at the Inn, only the village spirit which beckons for good deeds in return.</p>
