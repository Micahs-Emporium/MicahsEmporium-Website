  <h1>The Dining Hall</h1>
  <p> A gathering place for one and all with faces spotted every day, and ones only present for rare quiet nights. <br>
As locks are nowhere to be found, friends and family may come in at any break, or lack, of light they prefer. Naturally mending circles form from the elderly seeking community and purpose, kids take over thall stage in the corner for greats make belive voyages and the bar spends its time overrun with Ale and Gossip. <br>
Afterwards it will latch onto any and all organisms/corpses/plants in its reach and starts feeding off of that. <br>
The hearth rarely smolders out and the floors are near never not sticky in the oddest of places.  <br>
